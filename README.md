<b>Home construction cost estimation </b>
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model for estimating home costs. It uses various features such as h location, sqft, and number of bedrooms to predict the cost of a home. The model is designed for use by real estate professionals, home buyers, and sellers who are interested in estimating the cost of a home accurately. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model can provide more accurate estimates than traditional methods and can potentially help individuals make better-informed decisions when buying or selling a home. Ultimately, this project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of home cost estimation and provide a valuable tool for those involved in the real estate industry.
